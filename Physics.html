		<p>Welcome to Yutong Zhao's personal website! </p>
            <h2 class="heading underline">Why do I study Physics</h2>
            <p>  My original idea to study physics is very simple. As a little kid with little knowledge and full of curiosity, trying to understand  the universe is his first priority at his spear time. 
			</p>
			<p> In the darkest time of his early life, nature science including but not limited to Physics helped the little kid overcome the fear of unknown. Nowadays, the kid is no more young but still carries lots of curiosity.

			<h4>Some important resources</h4> 
			<p> The outbreak of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</a> was first identified in 2019 at Wuhan, the captical city of Hubei province, China.
			</p>
			<p> Data provided / recorded by <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU).</a> 
			The <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">  Github page  </a> can be used  to  extract the data in csv files.</p>

			</p>
			
			<p> An intriging video made by Minite Physics can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/54XLXg4fYsc"> here </a>. While the data plot of total confirmed cases v.s. new confirmed cases is given by <a href="https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/"> here </a>.</p>
			<p> The "COVID-19: Outbreak update"  by <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html?topic=tilelink">Government of Canada </a> with data of confirmed case.</p>
            <h3>Data Analysis on COVID-19 confirmed cases in Canada over time (Updated March 27 8:00 p.m.)</h3>

             <figcaption class="text-center"> (Left-top) The raw data we collected from JHU webstie as a function time with log scale in Y direction. 
			 (Right-top) We have choose the 20th confirmed cases for each province as the day 0 to illustate the increase of the epidemic. 
			 (Left-bottom) The spreding of the epidemic since the first confirmed cases for each province.
 			 (right-bottom) The figure created by using the total confirmed case v.s. cases confirmed in the past 4 days.</figcaption>
            </figure>
			
			<p> Apparently, the case in Canada of different province is still in a free exponential increase stage. The effect of the self-isolation / lockdown still need time to be observed. </p>

            <p class="text-center">  As the Lab reports of PHYS 1050 and PHYS 1030 are donwloaded with auto-generated names. A batch file to rename the lab reports to original names would make life easier. 
			Even though it may only save you a few minites each time, this can free you time from boring and repeating process. And you can focus on more meaningful tasks. Please find the MATLAB code: 
			<a href="./PHYS1050_file_compile.m" download="PHYS1050_file_compile.m">PDF Files Batch in MATLAB</a> </p>
			
			<p class="text-center">  PDF version of Lab reports can be readed use text.  To automatically do the word count for abstract and spell check. You can use the MATLAB code here：
			<a href="./PHYS1030_file_read.m" download="PHYS1030_file_read.m"> PDF Files read and word check in MATLAB</a> </p>
			
	        <p class="text-center">  Sometime the Attendence is very important and a good record of the class in case of some disagreement bwtween you and your students. In order to make the addentence easier, 
			a printable version can be find as following:

			<h4 class="heading underline"> Data Analysis </h4>
			<p> Eigenvalues and eigenvectors calculation. The eigenvalues are important and</p>
			<p> Time domain ODE calculation. </p>

            <p> For the communication using GPIB cables, you need to install a driver <a href="https://www.ni.com/en-th/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-488-2.html#329025	">NI-488.2</a>. </p>
