		<p>Welcome to Yutong Zhao's personal website! </p>
            <h2 class="heading underline">About Me</h2>
            <p> Hi, my name is Yutong Zhao, a research associate currently working in <a href="https://www.cancercare.mb.ca/home/">CancerCare Manitoba</a>  (Canada). 
			My research interests is focused on the image augmentation of Cone-Beam CT (X-ray) images, 
			this involves monte-carlo methods, big data analysis and deeplearning networks.
            And eventually this research would benifit every single paitent that recieve radiation therapy in Varian systems.   			
			  </p>
			
			<p> I graduated from the University of Manitoba and get degrees of Master of Science, (2020,Condensed Matter Physics)
			, and Bachelor of Science (2018,Physics, First Class Honors).
			In the meantime, I got the Bacholor of Science (Applied Physics/Nuclear Physics) from Lanzhou University in 2018, 
			since the 2+2 program between LZU and UofM.</p>
			
			<p> There are many of intersts of my life, such as : road trip, camping, hiking. Programming to
			resolve real-life problems, and so on. 
			I also appreciate the unfairness I have been through, which taught me the importance of justice.
			With all the previous experience, I believe in one thing that, sky is the limit.</p>
			
			<p>You can find my resume <a href="https://zhaoyutong43210.github.io/YutongCV">here.</a></p>

            <p> Living in Canada since 2014 (more than 6 years) and working here started 2021,
			geeting a permanent resident (card) of Canada would make the life much easier. 
			<a href="./Immigrate.html">Please find details here.</a> </p>
			
			<p>  Inelastic demand for real estate is true everywhere for Chinese people from an agricultural civilization 
			with the longest history in the world. Especially, a good community would provide you a good serive 
			and a peaceful environment for living. As people get emotional for a place that they lived long, 
			relocation is always an hard decision to make. Immigrate to Canada has become a popular choice for a lot of Chinese people.
			Even though the real estate market remains a mystery for new commers to Canada, we can still get a insight from the public data of various cities in Canada.
			Saving your time and saving your money.
			The real estate price of Canadaian cities. <a href="./Realestate.html"> Real estate big data in Canada cities.</a> </p>
			
			<p> A great spirt with curiousity loves to measure the world by his feet. Travel cross Canada is always one's target.  
			Residenting at geological center of Canada, there are a lot of 
			nature beauty wait to be explored. [<a href="./CanadaHeartbeat.html"> Yutong's Adventure</a>]</p>

			<p> The motherland where my family and me lived. People get emotional about the land. Chinese people are one of the  greatest people in the world.
