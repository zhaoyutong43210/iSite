		<p>Welcome to Yutong Zhao's personal website! </p>

            <h2 class="heading underline">About Me</h2>

            <p>
				Hi, my name is Yutong Zhao, right now work as an imaging lab specialist at <a href="https://algolux.com/">Algolux</a>,
				a company addressing the critical issue of safety for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles.
				I mainly contributed to the Algolux-Google project hardware side,
				which is an imaging quality improvement project for Chromebook ecosystem.
			</p>

			<p>
				I worked as a research associate in <a href="https://www.cancercare.mb.ca/home/">CancerCare Manitoba</a>  (Canada).
				My research interests is focused on the image augmentation of Cone-Beam CT (X-ray) images,
				this involves Monte-Carlo methods, big data analysis and deeplearning networks.
				And eventually this research would benifit every single paitent that recieve radiation therapy in Varian systems.
				Check Our Github page!
			</p>

			<p>
				I graduated from the University of Manitoba and get degrees of Master of Science, (2020,Condensed Matter Physics)
				, and Bachelor of Science (2018,Physics, First Class Honors).
				In the meantime, I got the Bacholor of Science (Applied Physics/Nuclear Physics) from Lanzhou University in 2018,
				since the 2+2 program between LZU and UofM.
			</p>

			<p>
			There are many of interests of my life, such as : road trip, camping, hiking. Programming to
			resolve real-life problems, and so on.
			I also appreciate the past unfairness I have been through, which taught me the importance of justice.
			I also appreciate the current work-life-balance environment.
			With all the previous experience, I believe in one thing that, sky is the limit.

				Real estate is usually the biggest investment of a family for their entire life. Especially, a good community would provide you a good service
				and a peaceful environment for living. Immigrate to Canada has become a popular choice for a lot of Chinese people.
				Even though the real estate market remains a mystery for a lot of new comers to Canada,
				we can still get a insight from the public data of various cities in Canada.
				Saving your time and saving your money.
				The real estate price of Canadian cities. <a href="./Realestate.html"> Real estate big data in Canada cities.</a>

			<p>
				A great spirit with curiosity loves to measure the world by his feet. Travel cross Canada is always one's target.
				Lived at geological center of Canada —— Winnipeg, there are a lot of nature beauty wait to be explored.
				Furthermore, moved to Montreal in 2022, the Quebec is even.
