		<p>Welcome to Yutong Zhao's personal website! </p>
            <h2 class="heading underline">Website Curriculum vitae</h2>
            <p> I am Yutong Zhao, a physics master student currently study in Univeristy of Manitoba in Canada. You can find my resume <a href="https://zhaoyutong43210.github.io/YutongCV">here.</a> </p>
			
			<p><strong>A little history:</strong> My hometown Langfang is a satellite city of Beijing which is located approximately midway between Beijing and Tianjin and its population is 4.74 million.
			                        The name of Langfang could be traced back to Song dynasty with more than one thousand years history (995 - 1000 A.D., named after the Lv duan, a famous Prime Minister of Song dynasty when he is the Undersecretary of finance, 
									meaning the "The House of Undersecretary"), the Guangyang district where my home is located has a even longer history which can be traced back to the year of  222 B.C. The Qin dynasty first set the Guangyang county there.
									</p>
  			                       <p> <b>A little geology:</b>  The city of Langfang is also known as the "Beijing-Tianjin Corridor" which has a 20 min long by high speed train to both Beijing and Tianjin.  The newly built Beijing Daxing International Airport is partially located in Langfang. My mother is a assosiate professor of North China Institute of Aerospace Engineering and My father is a senior instructor of Langfang Technician School.</p>

            <p class="text-center">  As the Lab reports of PHYS 1050 and PHYS 1030 are donwloaded with auto-generated names. A batch file to rename the lab reports to original names would make life easier. 
			Even though it may only save you a few minites each time, this can free you time from boring and repeating process. And you can focus on more meaningful tasks. Please find the MATLAB code: 
			<a href="./PHYS1050_file_compile.m" download="PHYS1050_file_compile.m">PDF Files Batch in MATLAB</a> </p>
			
			<p class="text-center">  PDF version of Lab reports can be readed use text.  To automatically do the word count for abstract and spell check. You can use the MATLAB code hereï¼š
			<a href="./PHYS1030_file_read.m" download="PHYS1030_file_read.m"> PDF Files read and word check in MATLAB</a> </p>
			
	        <p class="text-center">  Sometime the Attendence is very important and a good record of the class in case of some disagreement bwtween you and your students. In order to make the addentence easier, 
			a printable version can be find as following:
			<a href="./Attendence.docx" download="Attendence.docx"> Attendence sheet for PHYS 1030/1050 word version</a> </p>
			<h4 class="heading underline"> Data Analysis </h4>
			<p> Eigenvalues and eigenvectors calculation. The eigenvalues are important and</p>
			<p> Time domain ODE calculation. </p>
			
			<h4 class="heading underline"> Instrument Control </h4>		
            <p> For the communication using GPIB cables, you need to install a driver <a href="https://www.ni.com/en-th/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-488-2.html#329025	">NI-488.2</a>. </p>
