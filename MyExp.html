		<p>Welcome to Yutong Zhao's personal website! </p>
            <h2 class="heading underline">Yutong's Curriculum Vitae</h2>

			<p>
				Hi, my name is Yutong Zhao, I am working as an imaging lab specialist at <a href="https://algolux.com/">Algolux</a>,
				a company addressing the critical issue of safety for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles.
				I mainly contributed to the Algolux-Google project hardware side,
				which is an imaging quality improvement project for Chromebook ecosystem.
			</p>

			<p>
				I worked as a research associate in <a href="https://www.cancercare.mb.ca/home/">CancerCare Manitoba</a>  (Canada).
				My research interests is focused on the image augmentation of Cone-Beam CT (X-ray) images,
				this involves Monte-Carlo methods, big data analysis and DeepLearning networks.
				And eventually this research would benefit every single patient that receive radiation therapy in Varian systems.
				Check Our Github page!
			</p>

			<p>
				I graduated from the University of Manitoba and got the  Master's degree in Science, (2020, Condensed Matter Physics)
				, and a Bachelor's degree in Science (2018, Physics, First Class Honors).
				In the meantime, I got the Bachelor's degree of Science (Applied Physics/Nuclear Physics) from Lanzhou University in 2018,
				since the 2+2 program between LZU and UofM.

			<h4 class="heading underline">Some fun parts</h4>

			<p>
				<strong>A little history:</strong> My hometown Langfang is a satellite city of Beijing which is located
				approximately midway between Beijing and Tianjin and its population is 5.46 million (2020 data).
			    The name of Langfang could be traced back to Song dynasty with more than one thousand years history
				(995 - 1000 A.D., named after the Lv duan, a famous Prime Minister of Song dynasty when he is the Undersecretary of finance,
				meaning the "The House of Undersecretary").
				<br>
				The Guangyang district where my current home is located has a even longer history which can be traced back to the year of 222 B.C.
				The Qin dynasty first set the Guangyang county there.
				<br>
				The Anci district where I grow up was first set by the Han dynasty (202 B.C.). My elementary school, junior middle school is all in
				Anci district. Kinda miss the good old days.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>A little geology:</b>  The city of Langfang is also known as the "Beijing-Tianjin Corridor"
				which has a 20 min long by high speed train to both Beijing and Tianjin.
				The newly built Beijing Daxing International Airport is partially located in Langfang.
			</p>

			<p>
				My mother is an associate professor of North China Institute of Aerospace Engineering
				and My father is a senior instructor of Langfang Technician School.
				I am proud of them as the best parents in the world.

				<b>TIPS 1: </b>
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Peebles"> Jim Peebles</a>
				the 2019 Nobel Laureate in Physics, is my immediate seniors (1958).
				The Physics Department in University of Manitoba has only three honors degrees (Astronomy, Physics and Medical Physics)
				and we both have an honors degree in Physics.
				I happened to be continuing my graduate studies in the Physics Department at the time of the 2019 Nobel prize, which is a great honor.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>TIPS 2: </b> My another immediate seniors,
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Slotin"> Louis Alexander Slotin</a>.
				In 1946, during the Manhattan Project, he used his bare hands to prevent a criticality accident in a nuclear experiment
				and paid for it with his life since received massive radiation.
				He is the only person in this world who have "torn apart a nuclear bomb" with his bare hands.
